# Solving Transit Network Design Problem Using Many-Objective Evolutionary Approach
This is a JAVA Netbeans project based on JMetal 4.5 (http://jmetal.sourceforge.net/) aimed at solving transit network design problem (TNDP) by using many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MaOEAs). In addition, here we keep the datasets and statistical results used for our research works.

## Source code


## Datasets
We keep the datasets in the directory `IO`. There are currently four datasets listed below:
* Mandl 
* Mumford0 
* Mumford2
* Mumford3
New datasets can be added very easily at any time.

## Statistical results
We keep all the statistical results obtain throughout our research in the directory `Experiment`. The results include the following things:
* Pareto fronts calculated for different datasets
* Sets of solutions generated by different algorithms
* HV, GAS and GDS obtained by different algorithms, genetic operators

## Requirements
To use our framework the following software packages are required:
* [Java SE Development Kit 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnes)
* [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Downloading and compiling
To download our framework just clone the Git repository hosted in GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/ali-nayeem/JMetal4.5_Netbeans.git
```
Once cloned, you can compile the software and generate a jar file with the following commands:
```
ant
ant jar
```

## Running code
To execute a class named `TNDPExpThetaDEA`, just run this command:

````
java -cp Jama-1.0.2.jar:grph-1.6.29-big.jar:dist/JMetal4.5.jar jmetal.problems.TNDP.TNDPExpThetaDEA
```
